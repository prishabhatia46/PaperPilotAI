## What is this?

PaperPilot AI is a multi-agent research assistant that takes a topic you care about and does the heavy lifting — fetching real academic papers, explaining them in plain English, and helping you figure out where to start and what's still unsolved.

It's built for students, researchers, and curious people who want to actually understand a field, not just skim abstracts.
